# Module 0: The Developer's Mindset

Before diving into coding, it is beneficial to first understand the fundamental ideas behind the developer's world and develop a "developer's mindset", so that you understand not only **how** to code, but also **why** programming languages are designed in the way they are, and why you should code in certain ways instead of others. This is what this module is all about.

This module may seem to have nothing to do with programming, but the ideas are universal and broadly applicable to almost everything in the developer's world. It might be tedious to read through this module, so I'll keep it as short as possible.
