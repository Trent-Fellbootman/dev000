# Conclusion

In this section, we touched upon the most fundamental ideas
which form the foundation of the "developer's mindset".
Although these ideas seem simple,
they underlie virtually everything in the developer's world,
and for good developers, these ideas are typically second instincts.

The key takeaways are:

- To **abstract** means to give a definition of something to someone, disregarding all information irrelevant to that "someone";
that "definition" is called the **abstraction** of that "something".
- A **hierarchy** is a tree of abstractions formed by grouping things together according to some rule,
where the child abstractions relate to their parent abstractions in some way.
- A **standard** is an **abstraction** which is shared across multiple entities,
and provides a unified way that allows different entities to interact with each other properly.

In the next section, we will take a look at how computers are **abstracted** to software applications and developers;
this forms the basis of all programming languages and all software development processes.
