# Conclusion

![journey-milestone](res/journey-milestone.png)

In this module, we introduced some common abstractions for computers.
The key takeaways are:

- Developers almost always target abstract computers
to allow their programs to run on more computers,
and to program complex applications more easily.
- The closest-to-hardware abstractions of computers are Instruction Set Architectures (ISAs).
The common ingredients shared across most popular ISAs are registers, memory and instructions.
- Memory use cases, stack and heap are the basic models for using memory effectively.
    - Memory use cases defines what a piece of memory is for at each point in time.
    - Stack is a small, ordered piece of "buffer" memory from which memory can be allocated and accessed quickly.
    - Heap is a large, unordered piece of "buffer" memory that is generally slower to allocate and access memory from compared to stack.

Congratulations!
You now have a basic understanding of how computers look like to developers!

Developing the basic mindset and understanding how computers work is the first milestone
in the journey of becoming a good developer,
and you have made it!

You can feel excited, as this marks the end of the "prerequisite" modules;
starting from the next module, we will be discussing actual development,
and you will start to get your hands dirty on coding!
